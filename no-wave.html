        No wave came out of New York City as a reaction to the increasingly commercialized and poppy new wave genre. No wave favored sound based on dissonance and atonality with many musicians coming from a visual arts background. This included artists with no formal musical training. This created an environment open to experimentation and influences from genres such as free jazz and minimalism. The genre increasingly experimented with noise and became characterized by an abrasive aesthetic. While not achieving much prominence outside of the New York City scene, the music had a major impact on subsequent alternative music—Sonic Youth being a direct link to no wave and the alternative explosion in the 90s. While most of the groups did not last past the 80s a handful evolved past their no wave roots into even more experimental territory with Swans and Sonic Youth existing well into the 21st century.

        Swans is the creation of Michael Gira, being the only constant member over their initial 1981 to 1997 existence and their revival since 2010. Their first record <i>Filth</i> is a brutal cacophony of distorted guitars, basses, and various industrial style percussion. To compliment this sound, Gira&apos;s lyrics depicted transgressive violence, submission, and struggle. These themes continued on their next album <i>Cop</i> which is arguably their most intense studio release. The sound of Swans began to change in the mid-80s with the addition of Jarboe whose softer feminine vocals provided a complimentary contrast to Gira&apost;s. Swans released albums at a rate of one per year from 1983 to 1989. The 90s saw a shift into a more gothic sound with 1995&apos;s <i>The Great Annihilator</i>. Swans finished out their initial run with the two hour and 21 minute <i>Soundtracks For The Blind</i>. This album and their subsequent releases since their 2010 revamp have cemented Swans as an important band in the post-rock genre, which incorporates atmospheres and long grooves over traditional song structure.

        Sonic Youth also began in 1981 after several members performed at <i>Noise Fest</i> hosted at the White Columns gallery in New York City. The night the festival closed, Thurston Moore (who organize the event), Kim Gordon, and Lee Ranaldo stuck behind and jammed—effectively the first Sonic Youth rehearsal. They released their debut album <i>Confusion is Sex</i> in 1983. Definitive of the no wave style, this release also demonstrated techniques which would become hallmarks of the band&apost;s sound like prepared guitars and alternative tunings. Further developing their sound with more complex song structures as the decade progressed, the band would sign to DGC Records for the release of their 1990 <i>Goo</i>. This helped start the mainstream&apost;s acceptance of alternative which exploded with the release of Nirvana&apost;s <i>Nevermind</i>, also from DGC Records, in 1991. Sonic Youth never saw that kind of popularity but grew a cult following as the 90s progressed, releasing four more records that decade. They continued to put out music into the 2000s, but as of 2011 the band is no more.

        Glenn Branca was a major force in the no wave scene, leading groups which incorporated future members of the bands above. Branca moved to New York City after working in experimental theater in Boston. He formed the band Theoretical Girls in the late 70s, but would become know for his work with his guitar ensembles. He would incorporate several guitars utilizing alternative tunings paired with a percussionist to create massive waves of distorted guitar noise. His seminal work is the 1981 <i>The Ascension</i> with the title track coming in just over 13 minutes long. His later work incorporated homemade instruments and guitars of his own making—continuing to perform well into the 2010s. Branca passed away in 2018.
