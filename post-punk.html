       Post-punk emerged in the late 70s in the wake of punk rock music. While punk is characterized by its fast paced tempos and simplistic song structure, post-punk expanded on this formula by incorporating influences from other music genres and artistic mediums. This included taking influences from krautrock, dub, and electronic music as well as the works of French New Wave cinema and modernist literature such as that of Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud. This took the DIY ethics and transgressive attitude of punk and introduced more complex musical structures and lyrical themes. New York City, being one of the birth places of punk, was fertile soil for this sort of boundary pushing style—with a direct link from many punk musicians to the evolving post-punk genre.

        The Talking Heads were already a unique band in the New York punk scene when they relocated to the city in 1975. Started by students at the Rhode Island School of Design, their first album, <i>Talking Heads: 77</i>, was met with praise and gave us the enduring hit &quot;Psycho Killer&quot;. Yet, it was their next three albums, <i>More Songs About Buildings and Food</i>, <i>Fear of Music</i>, and <i>Remain in Light</i>—all produced by Brian Eno—which took their music in a new direction. In their collaborations with Eno, the band incorporated more electronic instruments, styles and rhythms from world music, and Dadaist elements. After a brief hiatus, the band returned with the highly danceable <i>Speaking in Tongues</i> in 1983 which featured album artwork from Robert Rauschenberg. The Talking Heads reached the peak of their success with this album. The tour they embarked on for it, which turned out to be their last, was captured in the documentary <i>Stop Making Sense</i>. The band did release three more albums before the end of the decade.

        Television formed in New York City in 1973. Coming out of the punk milieu of the time, the band became a regular act at the notorious CBGB. Despite still being a guitar driven band, Television had a cleaner, more polished sound than some of their contemporaries still adhering to the punk style. A major driver of this was guitarist and singer Tom Verlaine’s guitar playing technique. While still despising the grandiose guitar solos of classic rock, Verlaine’s style was still melodic but with a loose, improvisational feel. This is best seen on the title track of their debut 1977 album <i>Marquee Moon</i>. While the album opens with the driving &quot;See No Evil&quot;, the song &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; twists and turns for nearly 10 minutes—an unheard of length for a &quot;punk&quot; song. This album and the innovations Television made on it proved to be very influential to the local New York scene at the time and has had a lasting impact on alternative music to this day.

        Patti Smith was born in Chicago and made her way to New York via New Jersey after graduating high school. Initially, she was involved in the literary scene in New York City becoming well-known for her spoken word poetry. In the mid-70s she started a band called the Patti Smith Group and also became a fixture at CBGB. Her debut album <i>Horses</i> fused together the punk sounds of New York with her artistic, avant-garde sensibilities. The album opens with a spoken word introduction beginning with the lines &quot;Jesus died for somebody&apos;s sins, but not mine.&quot; The track then transitions into a frenzied cover of Them&apos;s &quot;Gloria&quot;. Smith has had a long and storied career, releasing several more albums and over two dozen books, most notable <i>Just Kids</i>, which details her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe—who shot the album covers for both <i>Marquee Moon</i> and <i>Horses</i>.
