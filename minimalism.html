      Art music, the kind of music most people tend to refer to as “classical”, has gone through many evolutions in the past 100 years. Composed music for large ensembles has gone from the traditional, often liturgical music reserved for societies’ upper crusts (Bach, Couperin, Buxtehude), to the showtunes that took the world by storm in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Gilbert & Sullivan, Rodgers & Hammerstein, Gershwin). The early twentieth century was also an important era for the avant-garde, with pioneers of techniques like 12-tone serialism (Arnold Schoenberg), the 43-tone series(Harry Partch), and even the infinity series (Per Nørgård).
      <br>
      <br>
      These innovations were developed in musical circles all over the world. When it comes to the New York minimalist scene, the international world of art came together to create a concentration of composed music centered on a few specific qualities. While John Cage is often cited as the locus point for Minimalist classical music (and he is certainly an extremely important figure in New York history), another entry point to the story of minimalism in New York can start in India with Pandit Pran Nath and La Monte Young.

        A master of the Kirana gharana style of North Indian classical music, Pran Nath was a composer whose focus on sustained microtonal purity and meditative performance centered the drone as an object of experimentation. La Monte Young, along with his partner Marian Zazeela, were already exploring the drone in music, and became extremely interested in Pran Nath after hearing his 1968 recording <em>Earth Groove: The Voice of Cosmic India</em>. Pran Nath came to New York to visit them, and ended up having a profound effect on their work. Young became Pran Nath’s first Western disciple, dedicating himself entirely to the study of the master’s vocal tradition, shifting his focus from arbitrary drones to acoustically precise, psychoacoustic intervals.
        <br>
        <br>
        Pran Nath's tutelage introduced Young, Zazeela, and, through them, the wider downtown community to the concept of just intonation. Unlike the standardized, equally-tempered tuning of the Western piano, just intonation uses mathematical ratios to create perfectly harmonious intervals. This principle, derived from the complex microtonal structure of the Indian Raga, became the foundation for Young's following work, particularly the piece he may be best known for, <em>The Well-Tuned Piano</em>. His focus was no longer on melody or rhythm, but on the timbral and physical quality of sound itself, experienced over long durations within acoustically pure environments created by Zazeela’s immersive light installations.
        <br>
        <br>
        This collaborative and pedagogical relationship cemented the identity of the Downtown minimalist movement. Pran Nath established the American Academy of Indian Classical Music in 1972, providing a centralized hub for this unique confluence of East and West. Pran Nath attracted many disciples in New York City, including composers Terry Riley, Henry Flynt, Yoshi Wada, and even Velvet Underground member John Cale. The influence of Pran Nath turned what might have been a purely intellectual exercise in drone music into a spiritual, physical, and highly influential sonic experience that continues to define the legacy of the American avant-garde.

        Morton Feldman has a reputation for his extreme quietude. His music, often described as "abstract expressionism in sound," is characterized by extraordinarily slow tempos and low dynamics, creating delicate, detached compositions where no single note or chord is ever repeated precisely the same way. This approach is as much about the listening as it is about composing, having audiences listen as carefully to silences as they do to sounds.
        <br>
        <br>
        Feldman’s work was deeply intertwined with the visual arts, specifically the abstract expressionists living downtown Manhattan. He was close friends with John Cage, Philip Guston, and Jackson Pollack. Feldman wrote music directly inspired by each of their art, however his most famous visual inspiration came from Mark Rothko, specifically the Rothko Chapel in Houston. Rothko’s paintings inspired one of Feldman’s most famous pieces, 1971’s Rothko Chapel.
        <br>
        <br>
        Feldman was an unambiguous New Yorker. Though his music was uniquely quiet and delicate, he had a famously large, loud personality. In his book <em>If 8th Street Could Talk</em>, Feldman writes about life and art in mid-century New York City and its inspiration on his art and philosophy. Named after the street that housed the legendary Cedar Tavern and many Abstract Expressionist studios, the book is a collection of lectures and essays on composition, art, and stories about life in downtown New York City. The works of Morton Feldman are heard not just in sound, but in the space and silence around it. His influence can be clearly heard in works by composers and artists such as Joan La Barbara, Jurg Frey, Michael Pissarro, Eva-Maria Houben, Eliane Radigue, and Annea Lockwood.

        Julius Eastman, a Black queer composer, pianist, and vocalist, was a severely underappreciated figure in the 1970s New York avant-garde. My first time encountering him was in a piece with Meredith Monk, whose performance ensemble he was a member of. But Eastman was heavily associated with John Cage, arguably the most famous composer in the minimalist tradition. Their relationship was complex: Cage admired Eastman's brilliance and even arranged for him to perform in Europe. Eastman, in turn, was deeply involved in performances of Cage’s work. However, their friendship eventually soured, partly due to personality clashes and partly due to Eastman’s increasingly provocative and politically charged approach to composition, which moved away from the detached, objective aesthetic Cage favored. Eastman’s departure from Cage's influence marked both resolve to forge a truly personal and confrontational artistic voice.
        <br>
        <br>
        But Eastman did not have the chance to gain the level of appreciation many of his peers listed in this section had. After years of struggle with addiction and homelessness, Eastman died in near obscurity in 1990. Worse still, due to his turbulent life and the chaotic dispersal of his belongings, the majority of his scores, tapes, and personal effects were lost or destroyed. For nearly two decades, his life’s work was only referenced in footnotes and hazy anecdotes, and his music became unperformable, disappearing from the minimalist canon.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the last decade, there has been a dedicated effort by musicians and scholars to recover and reconstruct many of Eastman’s major works. In turn, this has led to performances of his compositions by celebrated avant-garde ensembles, including Apartment House and S.E.M. Ensemble. Eastman is now celebrated not only for the importance of his identity as a Black queer artist but, more importantly, for the quality of his music. Pieces like the hypnotic, layered bells and percussion of <em>Feminine</em> and the abrasive, trance-enducing pianos of the provocatively titled <em>Evil Nigger</em> are now selling out their performances. With the rejuvenated interest in Eastman’s work, we can only hope that more of his music will soon see the light of day.
